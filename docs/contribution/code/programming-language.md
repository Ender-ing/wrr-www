## Tabs and spacing

The use of the normal tab (*also known as a hard tab*) character (`\t`) is not allowed! You may use **four** whitespace
characters instead of tabs to space code!

```js
foo() {
	// This is not allowed! (used \t)
  // This is not allowed!
    // This is correct! (used 4 whitespace characters)
}
```

## File start

All files that fall under this guideline should start with a multi-linear comment that specifies its use:

```js
/**
 * 
 * This file is used to...
 * 
**/
...
```
