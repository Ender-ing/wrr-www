# GitHub Contributions and Updates

In order to contribute to any organisation-owned repositories, you must adhere to the *project's specific requirements*.

If the repository has any GitHub workflows for testing purposes, your pull requests must pass the relevant tests!
In case of a test failure, the pull request will be rejected and closed.
